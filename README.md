# AC Phase Control 
This Latex Project is made to report the development of an "AC Phase Angle Control" for an "Electric Resistance Heater".  

The microcontroller used is a MSP430G2553 of Texas. Which is aditionally controlling a DC fan who helps to forze the warm air to flow. Since this is a module of a bigger system, Phase Angle is requested through UART.
